# Send SMS Survey to Clients

This was built for a client to send survey over SMS to clients who has left their business, and log those messages.  It was built using a React client and an Express Restful API.  

Built from the ground up on the front end it features React components, authentication, consuming API endpoints, and Redux. On the backend it has session based authentication, REST API, and consumes Twilio API to send SMS.

It was tested in the current versions of the latest browsers.
